### üìÅ Tutorial 3 & 4

**Topic**: Text Preprocessing & NLP with NLTK

**Description**:  
This tutorial introduces basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the NLTK library. It covers essential preprocessing steps including sentence segmentation, tokenization, case folding, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The tutorial also includes advanced tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) using SpaCy and word cloud generation to visualize frequently used terms.

The analysis is performed on a restaurant reviews dataset collected from Google Maps: [`GoogleReview_data_cleaned.csv`]([https://www.kaggle.com/your-kaggle-link-here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/choonkhonng/malaysia-restaurant-review-datasets)). This dataset contains customer reviews from restaurants in Ipoh, Malaysia, and is suitable for exploring real-world textual data in sentiment and linguistic analysis.
